Hi we are learning github.
GIT is used for Source code Management.
GIT is for local repo and GITHUB is for whole repo where everyone can see the code.
MASTER is the main branch in GIT where as MAIN is the main branch in GITHUB.
We push the  code form GIT to GITHUB with git push origin main command.
